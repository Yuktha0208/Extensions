        <div class="dropdown-content">
          <a href="Golden_gaytime">This is a gay theme for the<br>Adobe Brackets web development 
            <br>environment. It is gay.
            Properly formatted html will roughly align with<br>the colors
            <br>of the rainbow flag. A document's<br>line numbers also form the 6 colors!
            You can download this theme like any other Brackets extension<br>by searching through the
            <br>Extension Manager and installing it within the Brackets client.
        <br>Then, navigate to View><br>Themes. Golden Gaytime should appear <br>as one of the 
        selectable themes.<br>Code with pride!</a>

          <a href="hannah">A purple background.
            with added green, white, gold, and light blue colors.
            The easiest and quickest way to install the Hannah theme is to download<br>and install 
            directly through the Brackets extension manager. The alternative<br>is to download this repo by 
            clicking Download<br>ZIP in Github and install the zip file manually<br>through the extension 
            manager.</a>

          <a href="NeonLite">A semi-dark theme Neon effects on a light theme.<br>The light variant of 
            the NeonCode brackets theme<br>i made earlier.
            The largest use of neon is in<br>making the ubiquitous ‘neon signs’ for advertising.<br> In
            a vacuum discharge tube neon<br>glows a reddish orange colour. Only the red signs actually 
            contain pure<br>neon. Others contain different gases to give different colours.</a>

          <a href="cloud">
            Currently, we detect external changes purely by checking file<br>timestamps against the 
            last-sync timestamp recorded on Document.<br>Brackets triggers this<br>check whenever an 
            external change was detected by our native<br>file watchers, and on window focus.<br>We recheck 
            all open Documents, but with file caching the timestamp<br>check is a fast noop for everything 
            other than files where a watcher<br>change was<br>just notified. If watchers/caching are disabled,
            <br>we'll essentially<br>check only on window focus, and we'll hit the disk to check every open
             Document's timestamp every time.
            Synchronize the edition of your document<br>(if it does not exist it will be created) 
            directly to your<br>server without the need for an ftp or<br>similar user, as you do locally 
            and without<br>third parties.
            the easiest way to do it is with Dropbox, or<br>a Dropbox-like service. 
            As long as it creates a physical folder<br>on your machine, you can simply store your extensions 
            there<br>(for me it is /Users/ray/Dropbox/BracketsExtensions) and then create a symlink<br>between 
            that folder and the folder Brackets uses for extensions.</a>

        <button class="dropbtn">Beautify</button>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
          <a href="BEautify">Brackets Beautify can be run manually on the whole file
            or on a selection.<br>Use the Toolbar Button with the wand icon, the menu entry Edit
            Beautify, the<br>context-menu entry Beautify, or one of the keyboard shortcuts<br>Ctrl-Alt-B
            (Windows/Linux), Ctrl-Shift-L (Windows), Cmd-Shift-L (Mac), or define your own.
            The Beautify extension for Brackets<br>does exactly what its name
            implies. It takes sloppy,<br>unformatted<br>markup and makes it look beautiful 
            by adding<br>spacing and indents that make it easier to read.</td>
            To install the latest release of this extension use the built-in<br>Brackets Extension 
            Manager which downloads the extension from the extension registry.</a>
